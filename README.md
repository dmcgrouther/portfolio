Here is a little bit more technical information about my projects.

Blackjack
In this application one player can play against the computer until the deck runs out of cards.
For this project I utilized Javascript, HTML and CSS. 
A huge win for me with this project was planning ahead. I wrote out alot of psuedocode ahead of time and I was able to get the majority of the game completed in two days.
One challenge that I had with this project was how the cards would show up on the page. Eventually I solved those problems, and if I had more time I would try to make the computer slow down. As it stands the computer plays very quickly.

Book club
In this application you can write and edit stories. 
For this project I worked more with Javascript, heavily with Node, Express, and Mongoose. I also worked with DOM manipulation.
This project was a pretty big learning experience for me. I was not comfortable with the backend and this gave me the opportunity to learn more about something that I did not know much about. In particular, I had a challenging time with the edit and delete routes in Node. In addition I also had a problem with DOM manipulation.

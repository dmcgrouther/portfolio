Here is a little bit more technical information about my projects.

Blackjack

In this application one player can play against the computer until the deck runs out of cards.
For this project I utilized Javascript, HTML and CSS. 
A huge win for me with this project was planning ahead. I wrote out alot of psuedocode ahead of time and I was able to get the majority of the game completed in two days.
One challenge that I had with this project was how the cards would show up on the page. Eventually I solved those problems, and if I had more time I would try to make the computer slow down. As it stands the computer plays very quickly.

Book club

In this application you can write and edit stories. 
For this project I worked more with Javascript, heavily with Node, Express, and Mongoose. I also worked with DOM manipulation.
This project was a pretty big learning experience for me. I was not comfortable with the backend and this gave me the opportunity to learn more about something that I did not know much about. In particular, I had a challenging time with the edit and delete routes in Node. In addition I also had a problem with DOM manipulation. 

Dungeons and Dragons character application

This application is for creating Dungeons and Dragons characters and storing their information.
In this project I worked more with the front end styling, HTML and CSS. 
Challenges for me were cementing in MVC concepts and getting back into the groove of front end work.
One huge win is that this application turned out looking great. I am extremely pleased with the look and feel of the application and I want to use this with one group that I play with.

Project wayfairer

In this application you can create posts about the ten cities that are listed.
For this project I contributed by helping build out the backend with JS Node, Express, and Mongoose. 
A challenge I had was with learning the more complex aspects of React.
A huge success for me on this project was being able to build out the backend with one partner in a relatively short amount of time. From my challenges in previous projects I had, I was able to learn and I felt much more comfortable with the backend Javascript.

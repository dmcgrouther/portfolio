Here is a little bit more technical information about my projects.

Blackjack
For this project I utilized Javascript, HTML and CSS. A huge win for me with this project was planning ahead. I wrote out alot of psuedocode ahead of time and I was able to get the majority of the game completed in two days.
One challenge that I had with this project was how the cards would show up on the page. Eventually I solved those problems, and if I had more time I would try to make the computer slow down. As it stands the computer plays very quickly.
